Before contributing to Buildify,
it's crucial that your environment is configured witht he right tools.
Bear in mind that it's not enough with having the right tools present in your environment,
they should be the version specified in the repository.
Otherwise,
you might get different results than other contributors.

The three core elements that are required are [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/),
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/),
and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Ruby 3.0.1

Ruby is used by the web app,
which is implemented in [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/),
the [toolkit](/contributors/toolkit),
and the runner.
To install Ruby 3.0.1,
you can install it using your package manager of choice,
or a tool like [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) that manages and activates different versions of Ruby depending on the current directory.
chruby is not the only tool of its nature,
there are alternatives like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [rvm](https://rvm.io/) that work fine too.

## NodeJS 16
